# \<ros-action-client\>

A Polymer element for the roslibjs ActionClient.

- [Documentation](https://jstnhuang.github.io/ros-action-client/components/ros-action-client/)
- The [demo](https://jstnhuang.github.io/ros-action-client/components/ros-action-client/demo/index.html) unfortunately does not work unless you have configured rosbridge with SSL, since Github is serving the demo page over HTTPS.

To install:
```
bower install --save jstnhuang/ros-service
```
